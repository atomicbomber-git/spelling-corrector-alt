the method used in building the application is the software development life cycle with the waterfall model
the name of this application is soun that stands for or the national examination questions
based on the implementation of user design and testing, the android device request to the server via the internet then the web server process the request from android and query the database
the computer then sends data to the android device via javascript object notation 
it is as an intermediary between the server and the android application
therefore, the user also can do a test by using the simulation application that runs on the android platform
the teacher can manage the questions and see the scores that the students have achieved
while the students can practice answering the questions of english exercises independently, anytime and anywhere both online and offline
they can also see the score immediately based on the questions that they answered
they also know the solution, tricks, and tips on doing the exercises by choosing the menu provided
then, admin plays a role as a server manager, who is in charge to manage the system and questions consisting of crud 
it can be concluded that the use of mall as the learning media can become one of the alternative english learning models in order to prepare the students for practicing the simulations of the national examination
introduction the computer assisted language learning concept has developed into the mobile assisted language learning 
mall related to the use of mobile technology in language learning where students do not need to sit in the classroom or in front of their computers to learn languages
in addition, it allows users to become more motivated to learn english independently whenever and wherever they are
mall also has several characteristics that are not owned by call, including portability, mobility, social connectivity, context sensitivity, and individuality
in short, by using a mobile application such as the smartphone, the users can find information anywhere and anytime, including information about learning foreign languages, especially english
most of the junior high schools in indonesia still use a paper-based concept for implementing the simulation of the national examination
most of the students use the answer sheets for filling the answer of the exercises given
the implementation of the final exam simulation for the students only conducted based on the schedule set by the school
the teacher must re-type the question, then sort them out, and give them to the students in each class
after the students have finished doing the simulation, the teacher must checks the students’ work and give the score for each student
based on the explanation above, that will take a long time
the students cannot see the results that they obtained directly
they also only can do the simulations of the national examination at school and cannot practice the simulation repeatedly
therefore, it is necessary to make an application to facilitate the students and teachers
the researchers will design an android-based mobile application on the smartphone to be functioned as media in the learning process so that the students can do the simulation of national examination repeatedly and know the score obtained directly
we do hope that the application will give benefits to the students and teachers, especially in doing the simulation of the national examination for english subject
media with smartphone applications becomes one of the alternative english learning models
in addition, the students can use it in doing the exercise in order to prepare them for the final examination
as the additional information, the english subject is one of the four subjects listed in the national final examination to junior high schools in indonesia
the other subjects are the indonesian language, mathematics, and natural sciences
therefore, it will be more effective and easy if the students can practice some questions on their smartphone and find out the tips and tricks when they are doing these exercises
language learning for the final exam simulation of the english subject to junior high school students
this application will facilitate the teacher to manage the questions and the students can answer them into their smartphone
they can do the simulations of national examination both online and offline practices
by designing this application, the junior high school students can practice answering the questions of english exercises independently, anytime and anywhere in order to prepare the national final examination
in addition, they can see the mark immediately based on the questions they answered
in addition, the students can check the material achievements and discussion of each question that exists
last, they also know the tricks and tips on doing the exercises
in order to make this research in line with the development of science and technology, the researchers took several previous studies that closely related to the topic of this research, as reference material for application design
this research focused on designing and developing a mobile application for language learning and its use to junior high school students and teachers
several similar studies used as references for researchers in conducting this research
android-based interactive mobile learning application developed with the personal extreme programming method
this service created to integrate resources in client applications with e-learning servers
the m-learning client application has a feature to display course information taken, material information for each course, material information on file downloads, information on assignments, and forum information and add to forum discussions
for further development of android-based m-learning interactive, they still need additional features in the android-based m-learning client application for users so they can use it with other clients
for example, the addition of quiz features with the format questioner on the android-based m-learning client application
also adjusting methods to m-learning services in order to serve the requests from clients with more perfect features of mobile technology to enable the field of works or duties
another researchersaid that the use of android- based smartphones could support learners of english in accelerating the achievement of english language skills
the use of android-based mobile smartphones can also develop the skills of learners to adjust the segmentation of skills achievement
they can choose the applications they want such as speaking, listening, reading, writing, understanding language content, vocabulary, and even construction of english sentences
therefore, people can use that smartphones mobile as the learning resources to help them in developing their english language skills
a mobile learning application in one of the courses to help students for doing the exercises in the learning process
he also introduced the operating system that is practical and flexible, namely learning that is wherever and whenever
a mobile learning application could be used for the simulation of the english test of such as the test of english for international communication 
it aimed at smartphone users with the android operating system
the design of the toeic simulation application on android-based smartphones can help users learn toeic offline through mobile devices and increase the use of smartphones as learning media
the application could summarize various types of toeic questions from several books into an application that users can use it anywhere and anytime
mobile devices also could make students become more motivated to learn english independently
most of them feel happy in mastering aspects of learning english, such as listening or listening skills, reading, speaking, writing, adding vocabulary, and understanding grammar
the students could use the applications on android-based mobile devices as a tool that can help them understand the material given in class
this is also because there are multimedia support such as images; audio, video in the content of lessons on applications [11, 12, and 13]
based on the previous review, the researchers made novelty and technology breakthrough application
the mobile application would be equipped with various features, including features to display questions in accordance with the scope of a selected material such as expression, reading, and grammar
then the feature to set the try-out question with a random system, a feature to display the mark or score of the results of answering the questions, and the discussion of questions for the wrong answer
in addition, this application would also be equipped with some tricks and tips or strategies for answering the questions
cycle method with the waterfall model in building the android-based mobile application for language learning for the final exam simulation of the english subject to the junior high school students
the reason for using this waterfall model in the construction of this application is that the users have already known the needs; therefore, the researchers could do the work- process immediately
this model has the characteristic that each stage must be completed before it can proceed to the next stage
therefore, the execution of each stage must be done in a focused and completed method so that it can continue to the next stage
this model includes several stages of the process, including figure
1 the sequential phases in the waterfall modelthere were three stages conducted for this research
the first stage was the requirement
in this stage, the definition of needs was carried out by conducting interviews with english teachers as the subject
therefore, the information obtained was carried out on ongoing system analysis
then, the second stage was the design
the students and teachers conducted it after the researchers got the data needed
the design that was carried out was such as database design, display design, and the flow of the system to be designed
the tools used at this stage was yed
the third stage was the implementation
at this stage, the changing design has been made into a coding program that used the java programming language, and the tools used were android studio, firebase
teachers, there are some weaknesses in the system that are currently running: 1
management of the questions exercise by the teacher still takes a very long time
the process of evaluating the results examinations by teachers also takes a long time, so students cannot see the score immediately
the student can only take the simulation exercises at school, and cannot practice the simulation repeatedly
therefore, based on its weaknesses of the system, the requirements of the new system requirements can be determined, namely: 1
the application provides features in the form of multiple-choice questions randomly and students can do the exercises repeatedly so that the teacher does not have to print multiple simulations of the final examination
the application also provides a feature for viewing scores obtained so that it can make it easier for students to see their score immediately
in addition, students and teachers can see the discussion of the problems they are working on
the android-based application so students can practice this simulation anytime and everywhere
client-server overview design as a first step in the design, the android-based mobile application for language learning question concept would be made for english subjects to junior high school level as shown in the following figure: figure
2 client-server architecture figure 2 explains that in this case, the user can do a test by using an application that runs on the android platform
the android device will request to the server via the internet then the web server, will process the request from android and will query the database
the computer then sends data to the android device via javascript object notation 
it is an intermediary between the server and the android application
the name of this application is soun that stands for or the national examination questions
this application in its use only involves three types of actors namely teacher, student, and admin
the user acts as a user in this simulation application
these activities include working on the questions that are available in the application, inputting the answers to the questions, seeing the scores, reading the discussion about the national exams, and reading the discussion of the problem
then, admin plays a role as a server manager, who is in charge to manage the system and questions consisting of crud 
use case diagram the use case diagram of the application of the simulation of national examination for english subject can be seen in figure 3 below: figure 3 explains when a user opens an application; the user can choose a menu that includes tricks and tips, instructions for answering the questions, simulation of the national examination for english subject, solution and about the national exam

7 login menu for student 4) login menu for the teacher if the user is a teacher, the user clicks on the teacher button
8 login menu for teacher 5) input the question the page for the teacher could be used for inputting the questions
on this page, the teacher can add, edit, update and delete the questions
9 input question menu 6) questions after the teacher clicks the input questions button, then a form will be available for the teacher to input the questions figure
10 question menu 7) score or mark when the student has finished on answering the questions, then he/she could click ‘submit’ button, then the student's score will appear
the number of the correct and incorrect answer then would become the score of students
in addition, on the student's score page, it also displays a discussion of the wrong answers by the student
10 score at the testing stage, this application uses the black box testing method
tests are carried out to ensure the suitability of the application for the initial purpose of making the application and ensure that all functionality is running accordingly
can appear on the student page which will later be used by students to do the simulation of the national examination practices
table ii field a-z)  description : the student score will appear in the application when the student has finished answering the questions
table iii field application for language learning for the final exam simulation of the english subject for junior high school students
this application facilitates the teacher to manage the questions to be simulated by the students both online and offline practices
on the design overview, the user can do a test simulation by using an application that runs on the android platform
the android device will request to the server via the internet then the web server will process the request from android and will query the database
the name of this application is soun that stands for or the national examination questions
based on the implementation of user design and testing, the user acts as a user in this simulation application
these activities include working on the questions that are available in the application, inputting the answers to the questions, seeing the scores, reading the discussion about the national exams, and reading the discussion of the problem
