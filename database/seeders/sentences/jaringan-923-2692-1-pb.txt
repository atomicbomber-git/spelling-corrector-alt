enggunakan neural network backpropagation rizqia.lestika@yahoo.com to convey information in writing by one party to the other party
it functions include five things: means notices, requests, thoughts and ideas
a formal letter is a letter that contain the official or a particular business problem
along with the increasing demand for the current document digitalization, ocr (optical character identify the image of characters then will be converted into text files
furthermore, artificial neural network is one kind of technology approach that promising can increase the computer's ability to recognize and represent pattern
meanwhile, backpropagation is one kind of neural network algorithm which common used
therefore, a character recognition application using neural network backpropagation will be designed
application need a data image of document letter as an input, itâ€™s obtained from scanning, then continued by pre-processing, segmentation, characters text as an output
result of the test had been showed that, the best recognition accuracy rate on the characters trained, font arial, with learning rate 0.2, momentum 0.5 and 15 epoch is 71.95% and for the characters without trained, font times new roman and courier new, the recognition accuracy rate is 40.24%
overall, the result of percentage success the recognition of 790 characters in 15 document letter is 84.56%
keywords-- character recognition, neural menyampaikan informasi tertulis oleh suatu pihak ke pihak lain
fungsinya mencakup lima hal: sarana pemberitahuan, permintaan, buah pikiran dan gagasan
sedangkan menurut jatiningsih, surat merupakan bentuk tulisan untuk menjelaskan pikiran dan perasaan seseorang
